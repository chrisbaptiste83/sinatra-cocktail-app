## Welcome To Chris's Cocktail Collection 

This sinatra web application is a cocktail recipe tracker designed to keep track of a collection of cocktail recipes. A user can sign up by entering their desired username, email, and password. Once users sign up, they can create cocktail recipes and upload them into the application. A user can view the collection of cocktail recipes that has been created by all users. It is possible for a user to edit his or her recipe once they have created/uploaded it. A user can only, however, edit a cocktail recipe that he or she created. Finally, users also have the ability to delete a cocktail recipe created by them. The delete recipe option is available on the same page where a user can edit their recipe.
