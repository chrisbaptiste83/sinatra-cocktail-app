Welcome To Chris's Cocktail Collection 

This sinatra web application is a cocktail recipe tracker designed to keep track of a collection of cocktail recipes. A user can sign up by entering their desired username, email, and password. Once users sign up, they can create cocktail recipes and upload them into the application. A user can view the collection of cocktail recipes that has been created by all users. It is possible for a user to edit his or her recipe once they have created/uploaded it. A user can only, however, edit a cocktail recipe that he or she created. If a user attempts to edit a cocktail recipe that was not created by them, they will be redirected to the list of recipes and an erorr message will appear. Finally, users also have the ability to delete a cocktail recipe creatd by them. The delete recipe option is available on the same page where a user can edit their recipe.
